## 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `heights` representing the heights of bars in a histogram. The width of each bar is `1`.

Your task is to find the **area of the largest rectangle** that can be formed within the bounds of the histogram.

---

## 📥 Example

```python
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
```

**Explanation:** The largest rectangle has height = 2 and spans from index 2 to 3 (i.e., values 5 and 6).
Area = 2 (height) × 5 (width) = **10**

---

## 💡 Intuition – Expand While Minimum

For each bar `i`:

* Treat it as the **shortest bar** in the rectangle.
* Move **left** and **right** as long as the bars are `≥ heights[i]`.

### Formula:

```
area = (count_left + count_right + 1) * heights[i]
```

---

## ✅ Algorithm Steps

1. **Traverse** each index `i` of the array.
2. For each index:

   * Count how many bars to the **left** are ≥ `heights[i]`
   * Count how many bars to the **right** are ≥ `heights[i]`
3. Compute the area using the formula.
4. Track the **maximum area** found.

## 🧾 Brute-Force Python Code with Comments

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        n = len(heights)

        for i in range(n):
            current_height = heights[i]

            # 🔼 Count bars to the left >= current_height
            count_left = 0
            j = i - 1
            while j >= 0 and heights[j] >= current_height:
                count_left += 1
                j -= 1

            # 🔽 Count bars to the right >= current_height
            count_right = 0
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and heights[j] >= current_height:
                count_right += 1
                j += 1

            # 📦 Compute area for current bar as the smallest
            width = count_left + count_right + 1
            area = current_height * width
            max_area = max(max_area, area)

        return max_area
```

## 🧪 Dry Run Example

**Input:** `[2,1,5,6,2,3]`

Let’s take `heights[2] = 5`:

* Count left: index 1 → 1 < 5 → stop → `count_left = 0`
* Count right: index 3 → 6 ≥ 5 → continue → index 4 → 2 < 5 → stop → `count_right = 1`

→ Area = `(0 + 1 + 1) * 5 = 10`

## ⏱️ Complexity

| Type  | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Time  | O(n²) |
| Space | O(1)  |

> This is **not optimal** for large inputs. Use this approach when clearly asked in interviews to use “expand from minimum bar” logic.

---

## 💬 Interview Strategy

### ✅ Talk About:

* Assumptions: Width of each bar is 1.
* Brute-force vs optimized approaches.
* Importance of local expansion when bar is treated as min.

### 🚀 Suggest Improvements:

* Offer to use Monotonic Stack to achieve **O(n)** time if interviewer asks for optimization.

---

## 🏁 Summary

This approach is:

* Intuitive and interview-friendly.
* Good for demonstrating expansion logic and area computation.
* A stepping stone to optimized solutions.

---

## ⚙️ Optimized Approach: Monotonic Stack (O(n) Time)

The **Monotonic Stack** approach allows us to efficiently determine the **next smaller element to the left and right** for every bar.

### 🔧 Strategy:

* Append a `0` at the end to flush the stack.
* Maintain a stack with indices where the heights are **in increasing order**.
* When a bar breaks this order, pop from the stack and compute area.

### ✅ Python Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []  # stack to store indices
        max_area = 0
        heights.append(0)  # add sentinel bar

        for i, h in enumerate(heights):
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > h:
                height = heights[stack.pop()]
                # If stack is empty, width = i
                width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
                max_area = max(max_area, height * width)
            stack.append(i)

        return max_area
```

### ✅ Python Code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        num_bars = len(heights)
        index_stack = []  # Stack to store (bar_height, start_index)
        max_rectangle_area = 0

        for current_index, current_height in enumerate(heights):
            start_index = current_index

            # Pop from stack while current bar is smaller than the top of the stack
            while index_stack and current_height < index_stack[-1][0]:
                previous_height, previous_index = index_stack.pop()
                width = current_index - previous_index
                area = previous_height * width
                max_rectangle_area = max(max_rectangle_area, area)
                start_index = previous_index  # Expand left boundary

            # Push current bar with its effective start index
            index_stack.append((current_height, start_index))

        # Process remaining bars in the stack
        while index_stack:
            height, start_index = index_stack.pop()
            width = num_bars - start_index
            area = height * width
            max_rectangle_area = max(max_rectangle_area, area)

        return max_rectangle_area
