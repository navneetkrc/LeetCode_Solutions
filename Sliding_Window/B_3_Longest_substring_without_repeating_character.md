# 🧠 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the **length of the longest substring** without repeating characters.

---

### ✅ Examples

| Input        | Output | Explanation                     |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| `"abcabcbb"` | `3`    | `"abc"` is the longest substring |
| `"bbbbb"`    | `1`    | `"b"` is the longest substring   |
| `"pwwkew"`   | `3`    | `"wke"` is the longest substring |

> 💡 **Note:** The result must be a substring (continuous characters), not a subsequence.

---

### 📋 Constraints

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

---

## 🧭 Approach: Sliding Window with HashSet

### 🧱 Key Intuition

To find the **longest substring without duplicates**, we use the **sliding window** technique:

- The **window** expands by moving the `right` pointer.
- If a **duplicate character** is found, we **shrink** the window from the left until the character is removed.

This allows us to efficiently track the window of unique characters.

---

### 📊 Visual Illustration

Let's walk through the string `abcabcbb`.

```text
String:     a   b   c   a   b   c   b   b
Index:      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7

Window movement:
[ a ]         -> unique, expand
[ a b ]       -> unique, expand
[ a b c ]     -> unique, expand
[ b c a ]     -> 'a' repeats, move left
[ c a b ]     -> 'b' repeats, move left
[ a b c ]     -> 'c' repeats, move left
...
Longest seen: 3
````

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        left = 0                    # Start of the sliding window
        longest = 0                # Track the maximum window length
        seen = set()               # Set to store unique characters in the current window

        for right in range(len(s)):
            # Shrink the window if duplicate is found
            while s[right] in seen:
                seen.remove(s[left])
                left += 1

            # Add the new character and update max length
            seen.add(s[right])
            longest = max(longest, right - left + 1)

        return longest
```

### 📢 What You Should Explain During the Interview

1. **Sliding Window Rationale**:
   "We're using two pointers to dynamically adjust the substring range while ensuring all characters are unique."

2. **Why HashSet?**
   "We need fast lookups and deletions, and a set gives us O(1) for both."

3. **Time Complexity**:
   "Each character is added and removed at most once — total O(n)."

4. **Space Complexity**:
   "O(k), where k is the size of the character set (max 128 for ASCII)."

5. **Edge Cases**:

   * Empty string: return 0
   * All unique: return len(s)
   * All duplicates: return 1

---

## 🧪 Additional Test Cases

```python
assert Solution().lengthOfLongestSubstring("") == 0
assert Solution().lengthOfLongestSubstring("aaaa") == 1
assert Solution().lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcde") == 5
assert Solution().lengthOfLongestSubstring("aab") == 2
assert Solution().lengthOfLongestSubstring("dvdf") == 3
```

---

## 🧠 Tip: When Should You Use Sliding Window?

Use the **sliding window pattern** when:

* You are asked to find **maximum/minimum/first/last** something in a **contiguous subarray or substring**.
* You want to **efficiently update a window** instead of recomputing from scratch.

| Time Complexity     | O(n)         |
| Space Complexity    | O(min(n, k)) |
| Sliding Window Used | ✅ Yes        |
| HashSet Used        | ✅ Yes        |

## 🎙️ The Interviewer's Playbook: How to Impress

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to approach this problem in a real interview.

### Step 1: Clarify and Conquer (The First 2 Minutes)

Before writing any code, show the interviewer you're a thoughtful problem-solver. Ask clarifying questions:
*   **"What does the character set include? Just ASCII, or Unicode characters?"** (The problem statement says English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces, which is a good hint, but asking shows you're thinking about edge cases.)
*   **"Is an empty string a possible input?"** (Yes, the constraints say `0 <= s.length`. The expected output should be 0.)
*   **"Is case-sensitivity a factor? For example, is 'a' different from 'A'?"** (Based on standard interpretation, yes, but it's a great question to ask.)

### Step 2: Talk Through an Initial (Brute-Force) Idea

Even if you know the optimal solution, briefly mentioning the brute-force approach shows you have a structured thought process.

**You:** "My first thought is a brute-force approach. I could generate every possible substring, and for each one, check if it contains duplicate characters. I'd keep track of the longest valid one I find."

**Interviewer:** "Okay, and what would the complexity of that be?"

**You:** "Generating all substrings would be O(n²). For each substring of length k, checking for uniqueness would take O(k) time. This would lead to an overall time complexity of roughly O(n³), which is quite slow. We can definitely do better."

This sets the stage perfectly for your optimized solution.

### Step 3: Introduce the "Aha!" Moment: The Sliding Window

This is your time to shine. Transition smoothly.

**You:** "The brute-force is inefficient because it re-evaluates the same substrings repeatedly. A much better approach is the **sliding window** technique. We can maintain a 'window' of characters that we know is unique. We'll expand this window to the right, one character at a time. If we hit a character that's already in our window, we'll shrink the window from the left until the duplicate is gone. This way, each character is only visited a constant number of times by our pointers."

### Step 4: Whiteboard/Code with a Narrative

As you write the code, explain each part of your logic, just like the comments in the solution above.

*   **"I'll start by initializing a `set` to keep track of characters in my current window, a `left` pointer at 0, and a `max_length` variable at 0."**
*   **"I'll loop with a `right` pointer from the start to the end of the string. This `right` pointer is what expands our window."**
*   **"Inside the loop, the critical part: I'll use a `while` loop to check if the character `s[right]` is already in my set. If it is, I have to shrink the window. I'll do this by removing `s[left]` from the set and incrementing `left`. I'll keep doing this until the duplicate is no longer in the window."**
*   **"Once the window is valid (no duplicates), I'll add `s[right]` to the set and then update my `max_length` by comparing it with the current window's size, which is `right - left + 1`."**

### Step 5: Analyze Your Solution (Complexity)

After presenting the code, always provide the complexity analysis.

*   **Time Complexity: O(n)**
    *   **You:** "The time complexity is O(n). Although there is a nested `while` loop, each character in the string `s` is visited at most twice—once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer. Therefore, the total number of operations is proportional to the length of the string, giving us linear time."

*   **Space Complexity: O(k)**
    *   **You:** "The space complexity is O(k), where `k` is the number of unique characters in the string, or the size of the character set (e.g., min(n, 256 for ASCII)). This is because, in the worst-case scenario, our `set` will store `k` unique characters."

# 🎯 LeetCode 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## 📋 Problem Statement

**Given:** A string `s`  
**Find:** Length of the longest substring without duplicate characters

> **Key Point:** We need a **substring** (contiguous), not a subsequence!

---

## 🔍 Problem Examples & Visual Analysis

### Example 1: `s = "abcabcbb"`
```
String: a b c a b c b b
Index:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Visual breakdown:
"abc"     → length 3 ✅ (no duplicates)
"abca"    → length 4 ❌ ('a' appears twice)
"bca"     → length 3 ✅ (no duplicates)
"cab"     → length 3 ✅ (no duplicates)
...

Answer: 3 (substring "abc")
```

### Example 2: `s = "bbbbb"`
```
String: b b b b b
Index:  0 1 2 3 4

Every character is the same!
Longest unique substring: "b" → length 1
```

### Example 3: `s = "pwwkew"`
```
String: p w w k e w
Index:  0 1 2 3 4 5

Possible substrings:
"pw"    → length 2 ✅
"pww"   → length 3 ❌ ('w' repeats)
"wke"   → length 3 ✅ (no duplicates)
"kew"   → length 3 ✅ (no duplicates)

Answer: 3 (substring "wke")
```

## 💡 Interview Thought Process

### 🧠 **Step 1: Problem Recognition**
> **"This looks like a sliding window problem because..."**
- We need to find optimal **contiguous subarray/substring**
- We have a **constraint** (no duplicate characters)
- We want to **maximize** the window size

### 🎯 **Step 2: Approach Discussion**
> **"I can think of a few approaches..."**

**Brute Force:** Check all substrings O(n³)
```python
# Don't implement this - just mention it!
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i, n):
        if is_unique(s[i:j+1]):  # O(n) check
            max_len = max(max_len, j - i + 1)
```
**Problems:** Too slow, inefficient

**Sliding Window:** Maintain valid window O(n)
```python
# This is what we'll implement!
# Use two pointers + set to track characters
```

## 🎨 Algorithm Visualization

### Sliding Window Walkthrough: `s = "abcabcbb"`

```
Step 1: Initialize
s = "a b c a b c b b"
     ↑
   left=0, right=0, set={}, max_len=0

Step 2: Expand window (right pointer moves)
s = "a b c a b c b b"
     ↑ ↑
   left=0, right=0, set={'a'}, window_size=1

Step 3: Continue expanding
s = "a b c a b c b b"
     ↑   ↑
   left=0, right=1, set={'a','b'}, window_size=2

s = "a b c a b c b b"
     ↑     ↑
   left=0, right=2, set={'a','b','c'}, window_size=3

Step 4: Hit duplicate!
s = "a b c a b c b b"
     ↑       ↑
   left=0, right=3, 'a' already in set!

Step 5: Shrink window (left pointer moves)
s = "a b c a b c b b"
       ↑     ↑
   left=1, right=3, set={'b','c','a'}, window_size=3

Continue this process...
```

## 🚨 Common Interview Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### ❌ **Mistake 1: Confusing Substring vs Subsequence**
```python
# WRONG: This finds subsequence, not substring
def wrong_approach(s):
    seen = set()
    count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char not in seen:
            seen.add(char)
            count += 1
    return count
```
**How to avoid:** Emphasize "contiguous" in your explanation

### ❌ **Mistake 2: Not Handling Edge Cases**
```python
# WRONG: Doesn't handle empty string
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    # What if s = ""? This might crash!
    char_set = set()
    # ... rest of code
```
**How to avoid:** Always ask about edge cases upfront

### ❌ **Mistake 3: Incorrect Window Shrinking**
```python
# WRONG: Only removes one character when shrinking
while current_char in char_set:
    char_set.remove(s[left])  # What if we need to remove more?
    left += 1
    break  # ❌ Should continue until duplicate is gone
```
**How to avoid:** Use while loop, not if statement

---

## 🔄 Alternative Approaches (Mention but Don't Implement)

### Approach 1: HashMap with Index Tracking
```python
# More complex but potentially faster in some cases
def lengthOfLongestSubstring_hashmap(s):
    char_index = {}  # Track last seen index of each character
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for right, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in char_index and char_index[char] >= left:
            left = char_index[char] + 1
        char_index[char] = right
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_length
```
**Trade-off:** Slightly more complex logic but avoids while loop

---

## 🧪 Comprehensive Test Cases

```python
def test_lengthOfLongestSubstring():
    solution = Solution()
    
    # Given examples
    assert solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcabcbb") == 3
    assert solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("bbbbb") == 1
    assert solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("pwwkew") == 3
    
    # Edge cases
    assert solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("") == 0           # Empty string
    assert solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("a") == 1          # Single character
    assert solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("au") == 2         # Two unique chars
    assert solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("aab") == 2        # Duplicate at start
    assert solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("aba") == 2        # Duplicate in middle
    
    # Special characters
    assert solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("a b!@#") == 6     # Spaces and symbols
    assert solution.lengthOfLongestSubstring("12321") == 3      # Numbers
    
    print("✅ All test cases passed!")
```

## 📊 Complexity Deep Dive

### Time Complexity: O(n)
```
Why O(n) and not O(n²)?
- Right pointer visits each character once: O(n)
- Left pointer moves at most n times total: O(n)
- Set operations (add, remove, contains): O(1) average
- Total: O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
```

### Space Complexity: O(min(m,n))
```
Where:
- m = size of character set (e.g., 128 for ASCII)
- n = length of string
- Set stores at most min(m,n) characters
```

## 🎤 Mock Interview Dialogue

**Interviewer:** *"Can you solve this problem?"*

**You:** *"Let me understand the problem first. I need to find the length of the longest substring - that's contiguous characters - without any repeating characters. Looking at the examples, for 'abcabcbb', the answer is 3 because 'abc' is the longest valid substring."*

**Interviewer:** *"Good. What's your approach?"*

**You:** *"This looks like a sliding window problem. I'll use two pointers to maintain a window of unique characters, and a set to track what's in the current window. When I encounter a duplicate, I'll shrink the window from the left until the duplicate is removed."*

**Interviewer:** *"Sounds good. Code it up."*

**You:** *[Implements solution while explaining each step]*

**Interviewer:** *"What's the time complexity?"*

**You:** *"O(n) because each character is visited at most twice - once by the right pointer expanding the window, and once by the left pointer when shrinking. The space complexity is O(min(m,n)) where m is the character set size."*

**Interviewer:** *"Great! Any edge cases?"*

**You:** *"Yes - empty string returns 0, single character returns 1, and strings with all identical characters return 1."*
