# Sliding Window Patterns - Complete Study Guide

*Based on Greg Hogg's YouTube Playlist*

## Overview

The sliding window technique is a powerful algorithmic pattern used to solve problems involving arrays, strings, and sequences. This technique helps optimize brute force solutions from O(nÂ²) or O(nÂ³) time complexity to O(n) in many cases.

**Core Concept**: Instead of recalculating values for each subarray/substring, we maintain a "window" and slide it across the data structure, adding new elements and removing old ones as needed.

## Key Sliding Window Patterns

### 1. Fixed-Size Sliding Window
**When to use**: Problems asking for operations on subarrays/substrings of a specific size k.

**Template**:
```
Initialize window of size k
Calculate initial result
For each new element:
    Add new element to window
    Remove element that's k positions back
    Update result
```

### 2. Variable-Size Sliding Window
**When to use**: Problems asking for optimal subarray/substring with certain constraints.

**Template**:
```
left = 0
For right in range(n):
    Add arr[right] to window
    While window violates constraint:
        Remove arr[left] from window
        left += 1
    Update result with current window
```

### 3. Two-Pointer Sliding Window
**When to use**: Problems involving string/array matching or finding pairs.

**Template**:
```
left = 0, right = 0
While right < n:
    Expand window by moving right
    While condition is met:
        Update result
        Shrink window by moving left
    right += 1
```

## Common Problem Types

### String Problems
- Finding longest/shortest substring with conditions
- Anagram/permutation matching
- Character frequency problems

### Array Problems
- Subarray sum problems
- Finding maximum/minimum in sliding windows
- Consecutive elements problems

### Optimization Scenarios
- Convert O(nÂ²) brute force to O(n)
- Problems with "contiguous" or "consecutive" keywords
- Finding optimal subarray/substring

## Tips for Success

1. **Identify the Pattern**: Look for keywords like "subarray", "substring", "consecutive", or "contiguous"

2. **Choose Window Type**: 
   - Fixed size: When problem specifies exact window size
   - Variable size: When looking for optimal window with constraints

3. **Track State Efficiently**: Use hash maps for frequency counting, variables for sums/counts

4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Empty arrays, single elements, impossible constraints

5. **Practice Variations**: Different constraint types, multiple conditions, optimization targets
