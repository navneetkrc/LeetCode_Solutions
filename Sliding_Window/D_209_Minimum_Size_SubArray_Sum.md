# 🎯 LeetCode 209: Minimum Size Subarray Sum
*Complete Interview Preparation Guide*

---

## 📋 Problem Statement

**Difficulty**: 🟡 Medium  
**Pattern**: 🪟 Sliding Window (Variable Size)  
**Time Complexity**: ⏰ O(n)  
**Space Complexity**: 💾 O(1)

Given an array of **positive integers** `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the **minimal length** of a subarray whose sum is **greater than or equal to** `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.

---

## 🔍 Examples & Analysis

### Example 1: Basic Case
```
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

Visual Breakdown:
[2,3,1,2,4,3]
       ^^^^ 
Sum: 4+3 = 7 ≥ target, Length = 2 ✅
```

### Example 2: Single Element Solution
```
Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [4] already meets the target.

Visual Breakdown:
[1,4,4]
   ^ 
Sum: 4 ≥ target, Length = 1 ✅
```

### Example 3: Impossible Case
```
Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: Sum of entire array = 8 < 11, impossible to reach target.
```

## 🧠 Key Insights & Interview Discussion Points

### 🔑 Core Insight
> "Since all numbers are positive, if we can't reach the target with a larger window, we definitely can't with a smaller one. This makes sliding window perfect!"

### 💡 Why Sliding Window Works Here
1. **Monotonic Property**: Adding elements only increases sum (positive integers)
2. **Shrinking Logic**: Once sum ≥ target, try to minimize window size
3. **No Backtracking**: Each element visited at most twice (once by right, once by left)

## 🎯 Interview Solution

### Step-by-Step Approach to Share with Interviewer

```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        array_length = len(nums)
        left_pointer = 0
        current_window_sum = 0
        minimum_subarray_length = float('inf')  # Initialize to infinity for min comparison
        
        # Expand window with right pointer
        for right_pointer in range(array_length):
            # Step 1: Add current element to our sliding window
            current_window_sum += nums[right_pointer]
            
            # Step 2: Try to shrink window from left while maintaining constraint
            while current_window_sum >= target:
                # Update minimum length found so far
                current_window_length = right_pointer - left_pointer + 1
                minimum_subarray_length = min(minimum_subarray_length, current_window_length)
                
                # Shrink window: remove leftmost element
                current_window_sum -= nums[left_pointer]
                left_pointer += 1
        
        # Step 3: Return result (0 if no valid subarray found)
        return minimum_subarray_length if minimum_subarray_length != float('inf') else 0
```

## 🗣️ What to Say During the Interview

### 1. Problem Understanding (2-3 minutes)
```
"Let me understand the problem:
- We need the SHORTEST subarray with sum ≥ target
- All numbers are positive (this is crucial!)
- If impossible, return 0

Key insight: Since all numbers are positive, adding more elements 
only increases the sum. This suggests a sliding window approach."
```

### 2. Approach Explanation (3-4 minutes)
```
"I'll use a variable-size sliding window:

1. Expand the window by moving right pointer
2. When sum ≥ target, try to shrink from left to minimize length
3. Track the minimum valid length found

The beauty is: each element is visited at most twice, 
giving us O(n) time complexity."
```

### 3. Edge Cases to Mention
```
"Let me consider edge cases:
- Single element that meets target → return 1
- No combination can reach target → return 0
- All elements needed → return array length
- Empty array → return 0 (though constraints say length ≥ 1)"
```

## 🎨 Visual Algorithm Walkthrough

```
Example: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]

Step 1: [2] sum=2 < 7, expand
Step 2: [2,3] sum=5 < 7, expand  
Step 3: [2,3,1] sum=6 < 7, expand
Step 4: [2,3,1,2] sum=8 ≥ 7 ✅ length=4, try shrinking
Step 5: [3,1,2] sum=6 < 7, expand
Step 6: [3,1,2,4] sum=10 ≥ 7 ✅ length=4, try shrinking
Step 7: [1,2,4] sum=7 ≥ 7 ✅ length=3, try shrinking  
Step 8: [2,4] sum=6 < 7, expand
Step 9: [2,4,3] sum=9 ≥ 7 ✅ length=3, try shrinking
Step 10: [4,3] sum=7 ≥ 7 ✅ length=2, try shrinking
Step 11: [3] sum=3 < 7, done

Answer: 2 (minimum length found)
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Bug in Original Code
```python
# WRONG: Don't manually increment right in for loop
for right in range(n):
    current_sum += nums[right]
    right += 1  # ❌ This causes index errors!
```

### ✅ Correct Pattern
```python
# RIGHT: Let for loop handle right pointer
for right_pointer in range(array_length):
    current_window_sum += nums[right_pointer]
    # No manual increment needed!
```

### 🐛 Other Common Pitfalls
1. **Off-by-one errors**: `right - left + 1` (not `right - left`)
2. **Infinite loop**: Ensure left pointer advances in while loop
3. **Wrong initialization**: Use `float('inf')` not `n + 1`
4. **Missing edge case**: Check if no valid subarray exists

## 🚀 Follow-up: O(n log n) Solution

```python
def minSubArrayLen_binary_search(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Alternative O(n log n) approach using binary search on answer
    """
    def can_achieve_target_with_length(length):
        """Check if any subarray of given length has sum ≥ target"""
        current_sum = sum(nums[:length])
        if current_sum >= target:
            return True
        
        for i in range(length, len(nums)):
            current_sum = current_sum - nums[i - length] + nums[i]
            if current_sum >= target:
                return True
        return False
    
    left, right = 1, len(nums)
    result = 0
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_achieve_target_with_length(mid):
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1  # Try smaller length
        else:
            left = mid + 1   # Need larger length
    
    return result
```

## 🧠 Intuition and Strategy

This is a classic **sliding window problem**, where we need to find the **smallest window** (subarray) such that the sum is ≥ `target`.

💡 **Key Insight**:  
Since all numbers are **positive**, increasing the window (moving `right`) always **increases** the sum, and decreasing the window (moving `left`) **decreases** it. This property allows us to use the sliding window efficiently.

## 📊 Visual Explanation

### Sliding Window Flow:

```text
Target = 7, nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]
                   ↑        ↑
                left      right

1. Expand right → Increase window until sum ≥ target.
2. Contract left → Try minimizing window while keeping sum ≥ target.
3. Track min window length.

## 🧑‍💼 What Interviewers Expect

Interviewers are assessing:

1. **Pattern recognition**:

   * Can you identify this as a **sliding window** problem?
2. **Efficiency thinking**:

   * O(n) time is ideal; can you argue correctness and efficiency?
3. **Code clarity**:

   * Variable names like `start`, `end`, `window_sum`, `min_length` help.
4. **Iterative improvement**:

   * Did you initially try brute force? Did you optimize?
5. **Talking through**:

   * Can you explain your process and why it works?

## 🗣️ Interview Talking Points

✔️ "Since all elements are positive, expanding the window always increases the sum and contracting it reduces the sum—ideal for a sliding window approach."
✔️ "My goal is to find the smallest window whose sum is ≥ target, so I keep trying to contract the window once that condition is met."
✔️ "I track the minimum length dynamically as I slide through the array."
