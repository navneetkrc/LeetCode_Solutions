# 🚀 Jump Game II - Complete Visual Guide

## 📋 Problem Statement

**LeetCode 45 - Jump Game II (Medium)**

Given a **0-indexed array** `nums` of length `n`, you start at `nums[0]`. Each element `nums[i]` represents the **maximum jump length** from index `i`.

**Goal**: Find the **minimum number of jumps** to reach the last index `nums[n-1]`.

### 📊 Visual Problem Example
```
Array: [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
Index:  0  1  2  3  4

From index 0: Can jump to index 1 or 2 (jump length ≤ 2)
From index 1: Can jump to index 2, 3, or 4 (jump length ≤ 3)
From index 2: Can jump to index 3 (jump length ≤ 1)
From index 3: Can jump to index 4 (jump length ≤ 1)

Optimal path: 0 → 1 → 4 (2 jumps)
```

## 🧠 Core Intuition

The key insight is that this is a **greedy problem** where we want to make the **fewest jumps possible**. However, there are **four distinct ways** to think about the greedy strategy:

### 🎯 **Approach 1: Greedy Forward (BFS-like)**
**Mental Model**: *"Explore layer by layer like BFS"*
- At each "level", explore all positions reachable with current number of jumps
- Find the farthest position reachable with one more jump
- **Core Insight**: Think in terms of "jump levels" - what's reachable in 1 jump, 2 jumps, etc.

### 🎯 **Approach 2: Iterative Greedy Backward** 
**Mental Model**: *"Work backward from target to start"*
- Start from the end position and find positions that can reach it
- Always choose the **leftmost** position (maximizes jump efficiency)
- **Core Insight**: By working backward, we naturally find the optimal path

### 🎯 **Approach 3: Recursive Greedy Backward**
**Mental Model**: *"What's the minimum jumps to reach the end? Break it down!"*
- **Recursive question**: "If I know the minimum jumps to reach position X, what's the minimum to reach the end?"
- **Answer**: Find the leftmost position that can reach the end, then recursively solve for that position
- **Core Insight**: Optimal substructure - the problem breaks down into smaller identical problems

### 🎯 **Approach 4: Optimal Greedy (Range-based)**
**Mental Model**: *"Lazy evaluation - delay jumps until forced"*
- Track current jump range and farthest reachable position
- Only increment jump counter when we **must** start a new range
- **Core Insight**: We don't need to decide where to jump immediately - just track what's possible

## 🔍 **Comparing the Mental Models**

```
Same Array: [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]

Forward BFS: "Level 0→Level 1→Level 2" 
             0 → {1,2} → {1,2,3,4} ✓

Backward:    "End←3←1←0" or "End←1←0"
             4 ← 1 ← 0 ✓

Recursive:   "min_jumps(end) = min_jumps(pos_that_reaches_end) + 1"
             min_jumps(4) = min_jumps(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 ✓

Range:       "Range[0,0]→Range[1,2]→Range[3,4]"
             Jump when forced to leave current range ✓
```

### 🧭 **Which Mental Model Fits You?**

**🎯 Choose Forward BFS if you think:**
- "I want to explore all possibilities systematically"
- "Breadth-first search makes sense to me"

**🔄 Choose Iterative Backward if you think:**
- "Let me work from the solution backward"
- "I want to see the path construction clearly"

**🔁 Choose Recursive Backward if you think:**
- "This feels like a natural recursive problem"
- "I want the most intuitive mathematical formulation"

**⚡ Choose Range-based if you think:**
- "I want to be clever about when to make decisions"
- "Sliding window / range techniques appeal to me"

## 🔥 Solution 1: Greedy Forward (BFS-Style)

### 💡 **Algorithm Intuition**
Think of it like **Breadth-First Search**:
1. Level 0: Starting position
2. Level 1: All positions reachable with 1 jump
3. Level 2: All positions reachable with 2 jumps
4. Continue until we reach the end

### 📝 **Implementation**
```python
def jump_greedy_forward(nums):
    """
    Greedy forward approach - simulate BFS levels
    
    Time: O(n²) worst case, O(n) average
    Space: O(1)
    """
    if len(nums) <= 1:
        return 0
    
    jumps = 0
    current_level_start = 0
    current_level_end = 0
    
    while current_level_end < len(nums) - 1:
        jumps += 1
        next_level_end = current_level_end
        
        # Explore all positions in current level
        for i in range(current_level_start, current_level_end + 1):
            # Find farthest reachable position from current level
            next_level_end = max(next_level_end, i + nums[i])
        
        # Move to next level
        current_level_start = current_level_end + 1
        current_level_end = next_level_end
    
    return jumps
```

### 🎨 **Visual Walkthrough**
```
Array: [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
Index:  0  1  2  3  4

Level 0 (0 jumps): [0]
├── From 0: can reach 1, 2

Level 1 (1 jump): [1, 2]  
├── From 1: can reach 2, 3, 4
├── From 2: can reach 3
└── Farthest reachable: index 4 ✓

Answer: 2 jumps
```

## 🔄 Solution 2: Iterative Greedy Backward

### 💡 **Algorithm Intuition**
Work **backward from the target**:
1. Find all positions that can reach the current target
2. Choose the **leftmost** one (covers maximum distance)
3. Make that position the new target
4. Repeat until we reach the start

### 📝 **Implementation**
```python
def jump_greedy_backward(nums):
    """
    Iterative greedy backward approach - work from end to start
    
    Time: O(n²) 
    Space: O(1)
    """
    if len(nums) <= 1:
        return 0
    
    jumps = 0
    target_index = len(nums) - 1
    
    while target_index > 0:
        jumps += 1
        
        # Find leftmost position that can reach target
        leftmost_position = target_index
        
        for i in range(target_index - 1, -1, -1):
            if i + nums[i] >= target_index:
                leftmost_position = i
        
        # Move target to leftmost position
        target_index = leftmost_position
    
    return jumps
```

### 🎨 **Visual Walkthrough**
```
Array: [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
Index:  0  1  2  3  4

Step 1: Target = index 4
├── Check index 3: 3 + 1 = 4 ✓
├── Check index 2: 2 + 1 = 3 ✗
├── Check index 1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✓
├── Check index 0: 0 + 2 = 2 ✗
└── Leftmost that can reach 4: index 1

Step 2: Target = index 1  
├── Check index 0: 0 + 2 = 2 ✓
└── Can reach from start!

Answer: 2 jumps (0 → 1 → 4)
```

## 🔄 Solution 3: Recursive Greedy Backward

### 💡 **Recursive Intuition**
This is the **most mathematically intuitive** approach - think of it as **"What's the minimum jumps needed to reach the end?"**

**Key Insight**: If we know the minimum jumps to reach position/index X, then the minimum jumps to reach the end is:
`min_jumps_to_end = min_jumps_to_X + 1` #last index + 1 is the length of the remaining array

**Strategy**:
1. Start from the end position as our target
2. Find the **leftmost position** that can jump to our target  
3. **Recursively** ask: "What's the minimum jumps to reach that leftmost position?"
4. Add 1 for the final jump to our original target

### 🧠 **Why Leftmost Position?**
```
If positions 2, 3, and 4 can all reach target position 7:

Position 2: [--jump distance 5--] → 7
Position 3: [--jump distance 4--] → 7  
Position 4: [--jump distance 3--] → 7

Choosing position 2 (leftmost) gives us the most "room" for previous jumps!
```

### 📝 **Implementation**
```python
def jump_recursive_backward(nums):
    """
    Recursive greedy backward - most intuitive approach
    
    Time: O(n²) 
    Space: O(n) due to recursion stack
    """
    def find_min_jumps(target_length, jumps_so_far):
        """
        Find minimum jumps to reach position (target_length - 1)
        
        Args:
            target_length: We want to reach index (target_length - 1)
            jumps_so_far: Jumps already taken in previous recursive calls
        """
        # Base case: if target is at index 0, we're done!
        if target_length == 1:
            return jumps_so_far
        
        # The actual index we want to reach
        target_index = target_length - 1
        
        # Find the leftmost position that can jump to target_index
        leftmost_valid_position = target_index  # Start with impossible value
        
        # Search backward from target-1 to 0
        for current_pos in range(target_index - 1, -1, -1):
            max_jump_from_here = nums[current_pos]
            farthest_reachable = current_pos + max_jump_from_here
            
            # Can this position reach our target?
            if farthest_reachable >= target_index:
                leftmost_valid_position = current_pos
                # Keep searching for even more leftward positions!
        
        # Recursive call: find min jumps to reach leftmost_valid_position
        # Then add 1 for the jump from leftmost_valid_position to target
        return find_min_jumps(leftmost_valid_position + 1, jumps_so_far + 1)
    
    return find_min_jumps(len(nums), 0)
```

```

├── "Leftmost position that can reach 4 is position 1"  
├── "So I need min_jumps_to_position_1 + 1"

    └── find_min_jumps(1, 2)
        │
        └── "Base case: already at start! Return 2"

Final answer: 2
```

### 🤔 **Why This Recursion Works**
1. **Optimal Substructure**: The minimum jumps to reach the end = minimum jumps to reach some intermediate position + 1
2. **Greedy Choice**: Always pick the leftmost valid position (maximizes efficiency)
3. **Base Case**: When we reach the start (index 0), we're done
4. **Recursive Reduction**: Each call reduces the problem size

## ⚡ Solution 4: Optimal Greedy (Range-Based)

### 💡 **Algorithm Intuition**
**Lazy Greedy Approach**:
1. Track the **current jump range** and **farthest reachable**
2. Only increment jump counter when we **must** start a new range
3. **Key insight**: We don't need to jump immediately - wait until forced

### 📝 **Implementation**
```python
def jump_optimal(nums):
    """
    Optimal greedy approach using range-based thinking
    
    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(1)
    """
    if len(nums) <= 1:
        return 0
    
    jumps = 0
    current_jump_end = 0      # End of current jump range
    farthest_reachable = 0    # Farthest position we can reach
    
    # We don't need to consider the last element
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        # Update farthest reachable position
        farthest_reachable = max(farthest_reachable, i + nums[i])
        
        # If we've reached the end of current jump range
        if i == current_jump_end:
            jumps += 1
            current_jump_end = farthest_reachable
            
            # Early termination if we can reach the end
            if current_jump_end >= len(nums) - 1:
                break
    
    return jumps
```

### 🎨 **Visual Walkthrough**
```
Array: [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
Index:  0  1  2  3  4

i=0: farthest=max(0, 0+2)=2, i==current_jump_end(0)
     → jumps=1, current_jump_end=2

i=1: farthest=max(2, 1+3)=4, i<current_jump_end(2)
     → no jump needed yet

i=2: farthest=max(4, 2+1)=4, i==current_jump_end(2)  
     → jumps=2, current_jump_end=4
     → current_jump_end≥4, can reach end!

Answer: 2 jumps
```

### 🧮 **Why This Works**
```
Think of it as "jump ranges":

Jump 0: Can stay at [0]
Jump 1: Can reach [1, 2] 
Jump 2: Can reach [3, 4]

We only increment jumps when we MUST move to next range!
```
